      <description>This guide by Bitcoin Q+A was published on bitcoiner.guide website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;What is Hodl Hodl? # Like Bisq, HodlHodl is a decentralised bitcoin exchange. However, Hodl Hodl is accessed via a web browser rather than a dedicated app. At the application layer, it requires no KYC information although certain sellers do require this. I would advise you to go with a seller that doesn’t ask for your selfie, after all, that’s why we’re here!</description>

      <description>This guide by Bitcoin Q+A was published on bitcoiner.guide website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;noKYC # The de-facto way to obtain Bitcoin today, especially as a newcomer, is to do so through a regulated Bitcoin exchange. You hop onto a website, provide an egregious amount of your personal information, often including your name, address, banking details, drivers license and sometimes even a scan of your entire face or a recording of your voice!</description>
