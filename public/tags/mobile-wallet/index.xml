      <description>How to use the Lightning Network without trusting anyone? Take Back Control of Your Sats in the Lightning Network.&#xA;The guide written by Tony⚡️.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Intro # I would like to share a guide on Phoenix — the non-custodial Lightning wallet. This guide will be useful for those who already are familiar with the Lightning Network and have some experience using it. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;ve already been using a custodial wallet like Wallet Of Satoshi and you want to gain more control over your funds, hold your sats in Lightning Network, and minimize the level of trust to a third party.</description>

      <description>This guide by @econoalchemist was published in Bitcoin Magazine.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;If you have an iPhone and have bitcoin, then I highly recommend using Blue Wallet to secure your BTC. This article will walk you through the basic steps for installing, securing and using Blue Wallet on iPhone. But, before getting started, it is a good idea to have a pen and paper ready. Remember to start with small amounts of bitcoin until these concepts make more sense and you are comfortable putting your funds in a mobile wallet.</description>

      <description>Recently, I listened to an episode of SLP551 featuring a discussion between @stephanlivera and @benthecarman about Mutiny Wallet. Ben illustrated the straightforward process of getting started with Mutiny — merely sending a link connects you directly to the Lightning Network. I&amp;rsquo;ve been curious about Mutiny for a while now, so it&amp;rsquo;s about time I checked it out for myself. Let’s dive in and see what it’s all about.&#xA;This article by @runningbitcoin was published on stacker.</description>
