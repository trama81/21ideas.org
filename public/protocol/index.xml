      <description>Understanding how the focal point of Bitcoin development operates.&#xA;This article by Jameson Lopp was published in his blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;if you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to consume this essay in audio format, you can listen to it here (narrated by Guy Swann of the Bitcoin Audible Podcast.) The question of who controls the ability to merge code changes into Bitcoin Core’s GitHub repository tends to come up on a recurring basis. This has been cited as a “central point of control” of the Bitcoin protocol by various parties over the years, but I argue that the question itself is a red herring that stems from an authoritarian perspective — this model does not apply to Bitcoin.</description>

      <description>How Bitcoin Thrives on the Edge between Order and Chaos&#xA;This article by Gigi was published on dergigi.com website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;if you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to consume this essay in audio format, you can listen to it here (narrated by Guy Swann of the Bitcoin Audible Podcast.) Bitcoin works. No matter what other opinions you hold about this strange phenomenon, it undoubtedly works, marches on, or, as I (and others) have previously argued, is alive.</description>

      <description>This article by Gigi was published on swanbitcoin.com website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Why the internet doesn’t feel as clumsy anymore is twofold: (1) we got used to the novel concepts the internet brought with it, and (2) countless layers of abstraction make interacting with the base layer easier.&#xA;There is an ongoing discus­sion in the Bitcoin space revolving around the topic of user experi­ence, or UX for short. Bitcoin still feels weird, clunky, and compli­cated at times.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/bitcoin-governance/</guid>
      <description>This article by Pierre Rochard was published in his Medium blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Why do we care? # Bitcoin’s governance matters because Bitcoin is the first successful, most liquid, and most widely known crypto-currency. In the words of Michael Goldstein, “Sound money is a foundational pillar of civilization, and Bitcoin restores this powerful tool for social coordination.” If Bitcoin’s governance model is flawed, it could prevent Bitcoin from reaching its full potential.</description>

      <description>This article by Nick Szabo was taken from Satoshi Nakamoto Institute website. Originally published in 2001.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Introduction # Commercial security is a matter of solving the practical problems of business relationships such as privacy, integrity, protecting property, or detecting breach of contract. A security hole is any weakness that increases the risk of violating these goals. In this real world view of security, a problem does not dissapear because a designer assumes it away.</description>

      <description>This article by Phil Geiger was published in Unchained blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;In the bitcoin world, there’s a nagging question that has persisted for far too long. On the surface, the question seems plausible. It has even confused prominent bitcoin technologists and researchers into keeping an open mind about the answer. Will bitcoin be secure once the block reward subsidy ends?&#xA;Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which are released on a schedule on average every 10 minutes, starting at 50 BTC every 10 minutes for the first 4 years, decreasing to 25 BTC per 10 minutes for the next 4 years, and continuing to be cut in half every 4 years, in an event commonly referred to as the halving, halvening, or more recently, as “Quantitative Hardening.</description>

      <description>This essay by Adam Gibson was published in Reyify blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;In the modern nation state, courts (&amp;ldquo;justice&amp;rdquo;) operate with the threat of violence. The exact way a dispute is settled varies (jury, single judge, etc.), but the &amp;ldquo;finality&amp;rdquo; of the resolution they provide is based on the fact that the state asserts the final say, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t agree, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, because they have men with guns.</description>

      <title>Proof of stake is a scam</title>

      <description>This article by yanmaani was published in his blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Proof of stake is a scam. When I say that, I mean that proof of stake is (1) claimed to be a consensus system, and (2) constitutionally incapable of actually producing a consensus.&#xA;To understand why this is the case, we must first study how proof of work works, to be able to see why proof of stake is not an adequate drop-in replacement for it.</description>

      <description>Technical analysis of mining behavior exhibited by an entity that is plausibly Satoshi Nakamoto.&#xA;This article by Jameson Lopp was published in his blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;If you spend enough time in the crypto ecosystem then you&amp;rsquo;ll no doubt come across arguments that some projects have unfair token distributions because they were &amp;ldquo;premined&amp;rdquo; / &amp;ldquo;instamined&amp;rdquo; / &amp;ldquo;fast mined&amp;rdquo; by the project founders, effectively enriching themselves from the initial launch of the project.</description>

      <description>The Segregated Witness (SegWit) upgrade in 2017 changed the structure of transaction data in Bitcoin.&#xA;The main reason for this upgrade was to fix transaction malleability (I&amp;rsquo;ll explain this in a moment). The other significant change included a block size increase.&#xA;This article by Greg Walker was published on learnmeabitcoin.com website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;What was the main change? # Legacy transaction # In a legacy transaction, the unlocking code (and signatures) sit next to each input, so the unlocking code is spread throughout the transaction data.</description>

      <description>Taproot is an upgrade to Bitcoin which brought several new features and benefits to Bitcoin users. The Bitcoin community activated Taproot at block 709,632 on November 12th, 2021.&#xA;This article was published on river.com website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Taproot, Ordinals, and Inscriptions # Since early 2023, Taproot has introduced controversy in the Bitcoin space, as developers started using it to put other forms of data on the blockchain than transaction data, such as ordinals, inscriptions, and images in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).</description>

      <description>The perpetual Ethereum difficulty bomb is evidence that blockchains can be coercive, and Bitcoin is evidence that they don’t have to be.&#xA;This essay by Level39 was published in Bitcoin Magazine.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Can open-source blockchains be coercive? In a recent debate between Erik Vorhees and Alex Gladstein, Vorhees asserted that “there is nothing in Ethereum that is based on coercion, period.”&#xA;Vorhees went on to clarify:&#xA;“I have a pretty high standard of coercion.</description>

      <description>This article by Federico Tenga was published in his Medium blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Disclaimer: for education purposes some of the concepts described in this article have been simplified, and to avoid overwhelming the reader with new terms also the terminology may differ from technical specifications.&#xA;Recently there has been a growing interest around tokens on top of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. The idea of creating tokens representing assets that can be transferred and stored with the same security and convenience that Bitcoin offers is not new, it was indeed pioneered already in 2013 by protocols such as Counterparty and OmniLayer (formerly Mastercoin), and later adopted by Ethereum and other altcoins, which is also where most of the blockchain tokens activity happens today.</description>

      <description>This article by Tom Honzik was published in Unchained blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;If you’ve been using bitcoin for a while, you’ve probably noticed that some bitcoin addresses appear quite different from others. You may have also seen discussion around several acronyms beginning with “P2,” such as P2PKH or P2WSH. If you’re unfamiliar with what these acronyms mean, here we’ll look through all the standardized on-chain methods for receiving bitcoin throughout its history and explain some essential differences that make each method unique.</description>

      <description>The next Bitcoin halving is almost here. We explore whether the halving is priced in, if other coins are a model for Bitcoin, and fear of a mining death spiral.&#xA;This article by Yan Pritzker was published on swanbitcoin.com website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;The next Bitcoin halving (aka halvening) is almost here. In May 2020, the reward for mining new blocks will be cut in half from 12.5 to 6.25 Bitcoins.&#xA;A halving occurs after every 210,000 blocks (approx­i­mately every four years) until all 21 million Bitcoins have been released by roughly the year 2140.</description>

      <description>How is Bitcoin defended by energy? And what is a nonce? These questions and more are answered within!&#xA;This article by Arman The Parman was published in Bitcoin Magazine.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;How mining works is fascinating. When I explain it to people, I enjoy seeing their face the moment their mind is blown. I’ll explain it here, but just know, I’m imagining all your faces as your minds blow!&#xA;I have to start with hash functions.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/transaction-size/</guid>
      <description>This article by Greg Walker was published on learnmeabitcoin.com website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;You can measure the size of a bitcoin transaction in 3 ways:&#xA;Bytes (b) – Transaction size on disk. Weight Units (wu) – For fitting transactions in to a block. Virtual Bytes (vB) – For comparing fee rates between transactions. Bytes is the most straightforward unit. It&amp;rsquo;s used for measuring any amount of data on a computer.&#xA;Weight Units and Virtual Bytes are measurements unique to bitcoin.</description>
