      <description>Why bitcoin is not only the best investment of our time, and the only good “crypto,” but the only moral, economic and philosophically sound place to store your wealth.&#xA;This article by Aleksandar Svetski was published in Bitcoin Magazine.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Hint: Beyond Bitcoin, it’s ALL shitcoin.&#xA;I often get asked about “which crypto” is a good one to invest in. Of course, my answer is always bitcoin. Period.&#xA;In this article I’d like to lay out the rationale from three angles:</description>

      <description>by Eric Hughes&#xA;Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn&amp;rsquo;t want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn&amp;rsquo;t want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.&#xA;If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of their interaction. Each party can speak about their own memory of this; how could anyone prevent it?</description>

      <description>This article by Michael Goldstein was published on the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Suggested background reading music There&amp;rsquo;s a War Going On # Bonnie and Clyde cannot simply rob First National Block Chain. They can hack servers and unencrypted wallet files or scan low-entropy brain wallets. But the costs of obtaining bitcoins hoarded on a high-entropy, password-protected paper wallet, for instance, are incredibly high. A computer cannot be expected to brute force the wallet in the universe’s lifetime, so a trespasser would have to employ expensive tactics such as kidnapping and torture on any prospective, individual target.</description>

Few people know that this problem exists, but hey, that&amp;rsquo;s the nature of serious, non-obvious problems: they are invisible until they aren&amp;rsquo;t. The problem with the internet is that information wants to be free. And if something wants to be free as in freedom, given enough time, it will also be free as in beer.</description>

      <description>This essay by Robert Breedlove was published in his Medium blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Satoshi gave the world Bitcoin, a true “something for nothing.” His discovery of absolute scarcity for money is an unstoppable idea that is changing the world tremendously, just like its digital ancestor: the number zero.&#xA;Zero is Special # &amp;ldquo;In the history of culture the discovery of zero will always stand out as one of the greatest single achievements of the human race.</description>

      <description>This article by Gigi was published on dergigi.com website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;An open letter to the confused and dismissive.&#xA;It should be obvious by now, but I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I&amp;rsquo;ll have to spell it out anyway: Bitcoin, not blockchain. Bitcoin, not crypto. Bitcoin, not distributed ledger technology. Bitcoin, not DeFi. Bitcoin, not Web3. Bitcoin, not CBDCs. Bitcoin, not yield farming. Bitcoin, not centralized neo-banks that sell you fractional-reserve paper bitcoin. Bitcoin.</description>

      <description>This article by Jameson Lopp was published in Casa blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Bitcoin provides strong assurances around the predictability and scarcity of its money supply. I wrote a detailed technical explanation of how it works here.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s controversial to state that this scarcity is one of bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s key properties and fundamental value drivers. If this property is violated, we have a big problem. So&amp;hellip;do we have a problem?</description>

      <description>This series by Brandon Quittem was published in his blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Foreward # I need to give credit to Dan Held for publishing his 4-part series comparing bitcoin’s origin to planting a tree. While I loved his series, I believe a more robust analogy is comparing bitcoin to fungi. If you’re new to this topic, strap in — it is my honor to initiate you into the fascinating world of fungi.</description>

      <description>This article by Gigi was published on dergigi.com website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;The definition of life has been a challenge for scientists and philosophers alike. While many definitions have been put forward, what precisely differentiates the living from the non-living remains elusive. Are viruses alive? DNA molecules? Computer viruses? Biologically produced minerals?&#xA;Ralph Merkle, inventor of cryptographic hashing and namesake of the Merkle tree, made the argument that Bitcoin is the first example of a new form of life.</description>

      <description>This thread by Robert Breedlove was published in his Twitter.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;As ambassadors of Bitcoin, I believe we must speak the common tongue and avoid esoteric language so that our message can penetrate minds far and wide. Here, I will shed some light on the Bitcoin and cryptoasset universe in an exoteric nutshell. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin&amp;hellip;&#xA;When we look at the cryptoasset universe, there are two distinct hemispheres: 1) Bitcoin and 2) everything else, which are commonly known as Alternative Cryptoassets or Alts.</description>

      <description>The global pandemic and interwoven political and economic crises became fertile ground for Bitcoin to become a tool for human rights.&#xA;This article by Anna Baydakova was published on CoinDesk.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;“You can say that Bitcoin’s headquarters is in Lagos now. Or in Minsk. Or Hong Kong.”&#xA;The year 2020, shaped by the global pandemic and political and economic crises worldwide, made us reconsider many things. Stuff that didn’t catch much attention before starts to matter.</description>

      <description>This essay by Ross Ulbricht was first published in his Medium blog.&#xA;Read more about Ross Ulbricht on freeross.org. You can sign a petition for clemency here.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Something special happened in the first year or so after Satoshi gave us Bitcoin, something no one expected and many thought was impossible. Try to imagine Bitcoin back then, before you could buy things with it, before there was an exchange rate, before anyone really knew what, if anything, would happen with it.</description>
