      <description>This article by Peter St. Onge was first published on Mises Institute website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;One popular critique of bitcoin is energy cost per transaction. This doesn’t begin to capture bitcoin’s massive energy savings compared to fiat currency.&#xA;Bitcoin’s cost per transaction is well known, and often critiqued; one article in Wired magazine called bitcoin “[a] big middle finger to earth’s climate.” This is because bitcoin’s security, redundancy, and architecture are more energy intensive than traditional payments relying on a single point of failure.</description>

      <description>This article by Robert Breedlove was first published in his Medium blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Money is a tool for trading human time. Central banks, the modern-era masters of money, wield this tool as a weapon to steal time and inflict wealth inequality. History shows us that the corruption of monetary systems leads to moral decay, social collapse, and slavery. As the temptation to manipulate money has always proven to be too strong for mankind to resist, the only antidote for this poison is an incorruptible money — Bitcoin.</description>

      <description>The world’s reserve currency relies on oil, dictators, inequality and the military-industrial complex. But a Bitcoin standard could change this.&#xA;This article by Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of the Human Rights Foundation and author of “Check Your Financial Privilege”, was first published in Bitcoin Magazine.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;In its growth from conceptual white paper to trillion-dollar asset, Bitcoin has attracted an enormous amount of criticism.

      <description>This article by Brandon Quittem was first published in his blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;You’re living through a particularly potent period in history. But you already knew that. Since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, we’ve been in what Neil Howe and William Strauss describe as a “Fourth Turning.” The final act in a drama that began on the heels of WWII. Fourth Turnings are defined by the collective realization that “things are bad enough that we’re willing to actually do something about it.</description>

Michael Hopf.&#xA;Two of the pictures used actually come from the 1833–1836 series of paintings “The Course of Empire”, by Thomas Cole:</description>

      <description>Why it’s the most effective investment strategy for most people.&#xA;This article by Aleksandar Svetski was published in his Medium blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;“Buy Low, Sell High”&#xA;It’s the mantra of traders, investors and financial advisers around the world.

But much of their argument boils down to a premise in which all the world’s available energy is known, limited, or finite.</description>
