      <description>This thread was published by Dan Held in Twitter.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;I’ve signed up with Alcor, a cryopreservation company. As part of that, I get a quarterly magazine. The last one was a profile of Hal Finney. It offers an incredible new view into his personal life, ideals, and perpetual optimism, even against certain death.&#xA;Though widely known for his pioneering professional achievements across cyberspace and tech circles, Hal’s daily life paints a much more nuanced portrait.</description>

      <description>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.&#xA;This post by Hal originally appeared on bitcointalk. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know me, I&amp;rsquo;m Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement.</description>

      <description>A report by Adamant Research.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;Introduction # At the end of the 16th century, a rag tag group of rebel intellectuals and entrepreneurs founded a country on some of the least desirable land in Europe — so often flooded that it needed hundreds of miles of moats - while fighting an eighty year long war against the largest empire in the world.&#xA;From this struggle and melting pot of ideas emerged the Dutch and British golden ages, innovative economic institutions that changed the world, as well as one of America’s most successful socio-economic experiments: New York City.</description>

      <description>Abstract # In this piece, we list 19 Bitcoin consensus rule changes (or 18 as an accidental one “failed”), which represents what we believe to be almost every significant such event in Bitcoin’s history. At least three of these incidents resulted in an identifiable chainsplit, lasting approximately 51, 24, and six blocks, in 2010, 2013 and 2015, respectively.&#xA;This report was originaly published in BitMEX Research blog. Later it has been updated.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the 2013 Bitcoin fork</title>

      <description>This article by Arvind Narayanan was first published on Freedom to Tinker computer science blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;On March 11, 2013, Bitcoin experienced a technical crisis. Versions 0.7 and 0.8 of the software diverged from each other in behavior due to a bug, causing the block chain to “fork” into two. Considering how catastrophic a hard fork can be, the crisis was resolved quickly with remarkably little damage owing to the exemplary competence of the developers in charge.</description>
