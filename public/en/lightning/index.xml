      <description>This article by Tony was published on abytesjourney.com website.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;The Lightning Network has been growing recently, with around 11,000 active public nodes out of around 20,000 total. Besides the advantage of near-instant payments, there can be privacy improvements to Lightning as well. Unfortunately, there are scenarios where Lightning is not great for privacy.&#xA;I’d like to unearth some of these. Not as FUD about the network, but to keep people as informed as possible so they may privately use Lightning.</description>

      <description>Hold your horses, Darth will explain you how to &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; those charts.&#xA;This article by DarthCoin was published in his blog.&#xA;Contribute.&#xA;OK plebs, by another request from my readers, they asked me to interpret / read this chart, being scared that the chart is showing that many LN nodes are “running” on Amazon, Google etc and LN is “cEnTrAlIzEd”.&#xA;I think originally this FUD was launched on internet by the XRP/ETH guys, trying to diminish the normies “trust” in Bitcoin and create panic.</description>
